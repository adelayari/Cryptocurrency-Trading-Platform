# Cryptocurrency Trading Platform

This project,is a cryptocurrency trading simulation platform written in C++. It provides a basic framework for simulating cryptocurrency trading activities, including reading trading data from CSV files, managing a user's cryptocurrency wallet, making bids and offers, and viewing market statistics.

## Project Description

This project, was developed by [AYARI Adel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayari-adel-esim/), as part of the Object-Oriented Programming Specialization offered by the University of London and powered by Coursera. The Cryptocurrency Trading Platform is designed to serve as a learning and experimentation tool for those interested in understanding the dynamics of cryptocurrency trading.

Key Components of the Project:

- **CSV Data Reader**: The platform can read trading data from CSV files. This data is used to populate the simulated cryptocurrency exchange.

- **Wallet Management**: Users can manage their cryptocurrency wallet, which includes tracking balances in various cryptocurrencies.

- **Bids and Offers**: Users can participate in the simulated exchange by making bids (buy orders) and offers (sell orders). These orders interact with each other to simulate trading activities.

- **Market Statistics**: The platform provides basic market statistics, such as the highest and lowest prices for a given cryptocurrency product.

- **Timeframe Progression**: Users can advance the simulation to the next timeframe, allowing them to observe how the market evolves over time.
